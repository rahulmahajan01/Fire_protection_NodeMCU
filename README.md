# Fire_protection_NodeMCU
I worked on a project which used NODEMCU ESP8266 to detect the smoke level in the surrounding area. Whenever the smoke level was above safe level, the buzzer was triggered and a notification in form of SMS and call was sent using open source esp8266 IOT PLATFORM. The notification was also sent to an web application which showed direction to the place chip is installed.
here the following components were used
1) MQ-35 Smoke Detector
2) Arduino Uno
3) Node Mcu

here the node mcu was integrated with IFTT web aplets which helped us in sending the automated text messages
